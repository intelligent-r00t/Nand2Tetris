# Nand2Tetris

This project is part of the Nand2Tetris course completed at Mississippi State University. The course begins with basic gate design and progresses to building a fully functional computer based on the Hack architecture.

Key highlights of the course:

Designed and implemented a variety of projects using Assembly, C++, and Python.
Built a custom disassembler to translate Hack machine code back into Hack assembly language.
Gained experience in low-level computing concepts, from logic gates to high-level architecture design.
